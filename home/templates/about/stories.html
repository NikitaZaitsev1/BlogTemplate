                <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it
                    nearly impossible to
                    counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain
                    technologyâ€”a
                    distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of
                    cryptocurrencies is that they are
                    generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government
                    interference or
                    manipulation.</p>
